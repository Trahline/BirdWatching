In this repository there is a program for the iphone. It allows users to record types of birds and where they saw them. It automatically uses the date from the phone so they do not have to enter it. THe only text they are responsible for is the name of the bird and where they saw it. 

I learned that you can add and link different scenes to the main storyboard view. This was really confusing because I could not for the life of me figure out why they kept saying go to add scene until i realised you had to physically add another scene then link it to the main scene. I was going to ask you on monday how to add a scene and link them but i figured it out. I think i have a much better understanding of how the code and the scenes are finally linking up and connecting to make a whole app.
